              We had to research the field of technology, and we chose this
              topic: what areas technology professionals work in, what they do,
              and why they choose those fields. We looked deeper into this topic
              and explored the reasons behind their choices. But why did we
              choose this topic? Because we thought that as first-year students,
              this research would help us better understand which field we want
              to work in the future. Through this, we realized in which area we
              could be more successful and where we could improve ourselves the
              most.

          Security Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)
        </h1>

              <b>What is Confidentiality?</b> Confidentiality means keeping data
              secret. Only the right people should see or change the
              information. Example: A doctor can see a patient’s medical
              records, but other people cannot. Threats to Confidentiality<br />
              1. Hacking – criminals try to steal data.<br />
              2. Social engineering attacks – tricks like phishing emails.<br />
              3. Data interception – listening to internet traffic.<br />
              4. Stolen devices – lost phones or laptops.<br />
              5. Wrong access permissions – someone gets access to data by
              mistake.<br />
              <b>What is Integrity? </b>Integrity means data stays correct and does not
          change without permission. Example: If a bank sends a payment of $100,
          no one should change it to $1,000. Threats to Integrity 1. Hacking and
          data modification – attackers change information. 2. Data corruption –
          errors that break files. 3. Man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) – someone
          changes data during transfer. 4. SQL injections – hackers put bad code
          into databases. 5. Malware and ransomware – viruses that damage data.<br />
          <b>What is Availability?</b>
          Availability means data is always accessible when needed.
          Example: A bank’s website should work 24/7, even during an attack.

                In cybersecurity, Red Team and Blue Team have important jobs. Red Team pretends to be hackers and attacks, while Blue Team protects the company. They work together to find and fix security problems.The Red Team is a group of security experts who act like hackers. They test a company’s security by trying to break into its systems.The Blue Team is a group of security experts who defend the company. They watch the system, find threats, and stop cyberattacks.
                Sometimes, Red Team and Blue Team do not work well together. Purple Team helps them communicate and improve security.
                Red Team and Blue Team are very important in cybersecurity. Red Team finds security problems, Blue Team defends, and Purple Team helps them work together. This teamwork makes companies stronger against cyber threats.

                A front-end developer is a person who builds the visible part of a website or application. They focus on what users see and interact with. Their main job is to create the layout, design, structure, and behavior of a website. This includes elements like buttons, text, images, and navigation. They use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop these elements. A front-end developer ensures that the website is user-friendly and visually appealing. They also make sure the site works properly on different devices and screen sizes. They collaborate with back-end developers to ensure the entire website functions smoothly. A front-end developer must understand how users interact with a site and aim to improve the experience. In today’s digital world, front-end developers play a vital role in web development.

                Software is a collection of programs, data, and instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It can be divided into two main categories: system software and application software. System software includes the operating system and other utilities that manage computer hardware and resources, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. Application software, on the other hand, includes programs that allow users to perform tasks, like word processors, browsers, or games.
Software is written using programming languages like Python, Java, or C++. It is designed to meet the needs of users, whether for personal, business, or entertainment purposes. Developers create software through coding, debugging, and testing. Over time, software can be updated with new features or improvements. Software is essential in our daily lives, as it powers everything from smartphones to large-scale business systems. 

In short, software is what makes computers and other devices functional, providing them with the instructions to execute various tasks. </p>

                AI engineering is the field of designing, developing, and maintaining artificial intelligence systems. It combines computer science, data science, and engineering to create intelligent machines and software that can mimic human behavior, learn from data, and make decisions. AI engineering involves building models and algorithms that allow computers to perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, image analysis, and decision-making.

AI engineers use machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and other AI technologies to create systems that can solve complex problems. They work with large datasets to train AI models, ensuring that these models are accurate and efficient. AI engineers also need to optimize these systems to run effectively in real-world environments.
